# substrate-benchmark-machine

Different Substrate chains can have different hardware requirements.\
It is therefore important to be able to quickly gauge if a piece of hardware
fits a chains' requirements.\
The `substrate-benchmark-machine` command archives this by measuring key metrics
and making them comparable.

Installing the command looks like this:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/btwiuse/substrate-benchmark-machine
```

## Output

Perform quick hardware check:

```pre
$ substrate-benchmark-machine

[INFO] The hardware fails to meet the requirements
Error: One of the benchmarks had a score that was lower than its requirement
```

The _score_ is the average result of each benchmark. It always adheres to
"higher is better".

The _category_ indicate which part of the hardware was benchmarked:

- **CPU** Processor intensive task
- **Memory** RAM intensive task
- **Disk** Hard drive intensive task

The _function_ is the concrete benchmark that was run:

- **BLAKE2-256** The throughput of the [Blake2-256] cryptographic hashing
  function with 32 KiB input. The [blake2_256 function] is used in many places
  in Substrate. The throughput of a hash function strongly depends on the input
  size, therefore we settled to use a fixed input size for comparable results.
- **SR25519 Verify** Sr25519 is an optimized version of the [Curve25519]
  signature scheme. Signature verification is used by Substrate when verifying
  extrinsics and blocks.
- **Copy** The throughput of copying memory from one place in the RAM to
  another.
- **Seq Write** The throughput of writing data to the storage location
  sequentially. It is important that the same disk is used that will later-on be
  used to store the chain data.
- **Rnd Write** The throughput of writing data to the storage location in a
  random order. This is normally much slower than the sequential write.

The _score_ needs to reach the _minimum_ in order to pass the benchmark. This
can be reduced with the `--tolerance` flag.

The _result_ indicated if a specific benchmark was passed by the machine or not.
The percent number is the relative score reached to the _minimum_ that is
needed. The `--tolerance` flag is taken into account for this decision. For
example a benchmark that passes even with 95% since the _tolerance_ was set to
10% would look like this: `‚úÖ Pass ( 95.0 %)`.

## Interpretation

Ideally all results show a `Pass` and the program exits with code 0. Currently
some of the benchmarks can fail even on reference hardware; they are still being
improved to make them more deterministic.\
Make sure to run nothing else on the machine when benchmarking it.\
You can re-run them multiple times to get more reliable results.

## Arguments

- `--tolerance` A percent number to reduce the _minimum_ requirement. This
  should be used to ignore outliers of the benchmarks. The default value is 10%.
- `--verify-duration` How long the verification benchmark should run.
- `--disk-duration` How long the _read_ and _write_ benchmarks should run each.
- `--allow-fail` Always exit the program with code 0.
- `--chain` / `--dev` Specify the chain config to use. This will be used to
  compare the results with the requirements of the chain (WIP).
- [`--base-path`]

## FAQs

### How to solve `‚ö†  The hardware does not meet the minimal requirements for role 'Authority'.`

This error message may appear for different reasons:

a) You node has low-spec hardware.

b) Your node meets the minimum requirement, but:

- you have other CPU/IO intensive process running while the node starts.

- the quick check doesn't have any tolerance of slightly lower scores.

In order to decide if you should upgrade your hardware, you should stop the gear
node and other resource-heavy processes, and run the full machine benchmark:

```
substrate-benchmark-machine --full
```

If some of the benchmarks still fail, then you should upgrade your hardware
accordingly until you get all 5 ‚úÖ's, otherwise you don't have to.

Note that in case you get low CPU scores, increasing the number of cores isn't
gonna help because it measures only single-core performance, you should upgrade
to more powerful processors to get higher scores.
